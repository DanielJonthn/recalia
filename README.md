## 💡 Why I Built This

This project began as a way to sharpen my frontend development skills using React and TypeScript. Along the way, it became a fun exercise in building smooth UI interactions, managing game state logic, and creating something both simple and satisfying to use. Sometimes, the best ideas come from just building — no pressure, just play.
